What is Assassin?
----------------

Assassin is still in development, but I'm hoping to get it finished soon. If you have some cool ideas, feel free to share them with me.
You can also subscribe to update to get notified once this plugin is ready! :)

This plugin will handle pvp in a whole new way! You remember that time you killed Bob? Bob came for you to take his revenge, he brought all his friends and annihilated you. Next time you will make sure you kill Bob anonymously, so he will not have a personal grudge against you.

The Assassin plugin tries to limit the amount of PvP by adding consequences and requirements for player kills. Now, not everyone can attack anybody at any given time. So random killing just because someone walks by will not happen that often.

Features
----------------

* Hide your identity put on that mask and become an Assassin!
* PvP is disabled normally
* Assassin's can attack other players and other Assassin's
* Charge players to become an Assassin
* Assassin's will have different name tags
* When a Assassin kills/is killed by a player, his name will not show up in the death message
* Limit the amount of Assassin's running around
* Once in Assassin mode, you can not remove your mask.
* Assassin mask will be removed after X amount of minutes in game time. (I would suggest something around 2 hours)
* Everything will be highly customizable.
