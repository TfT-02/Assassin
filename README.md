What is Assassin?
----------------
!!! WIP !!!

This project is not finished.
Assassin is a plugin for the Bukkit server that provides a cool way to handle PVP.

How does it work?
----------------
While holding a block of Black Wool* type in '/assassin activate' to activate Assassin Mode. You will now become an Assassin, 
your name plate will turn RED and change to [ASSASSIN]. Once a [ASSASSIN] you will be allowed to kill other players or other [ASSASSINS].
Other players can also attack an [ASSASSIN].

Assassin Mode will last for 2 hours*, Assassin Mode can cost money*
When someone is killed by an [ASSASSIN] the name of the [ASSASSIN] will NOT be shown in name.
There can only be 5* [ASSASSINS] at the same time.

*configurable
